* Use UNIXServer/UNIXSockets to communicate
* Use TOML for the config file
* Add how to get client-id/secret to README.md to get the gem working.
* Update 'Usage' in README.md
* Consider having the --status command return a reply that is printed to stdout
  as well as the notification. Or a separate status command just for stdout.
* Send me an e-mail at the start/end of each day/week of the most popular posts
