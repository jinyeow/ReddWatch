NOTE: use r/all to test the app because it gets updated with new posts regularly.

    check.
* Add tests
* Use YAML/TOML for the config file
* Add how to get client-id/secret to README.md to get the gem working.
* Update 'Usage' in README.md
* Send me an e-mail at the start/end of each day/week of the most popular posts
