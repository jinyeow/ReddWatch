* Think about how the server is being stopped - do we need to Process.kill?
  Maybe we can forgo having a PID_FILE and just look for a FIFO_FILE??
* Implement 'list' related functionality
* Send me an e-mail at the start/end of each day/week of the most popular posts
* Add how to get client-id/secret to README.md to get the gem working.
